Below is a step-by-step explanation of how the **Pumping Lemma for regular languages** is being applied to show that a particular language (with the property \(\lvert w\rvert_a = 2 \cdot \lvert w\rvert_b\)) is **not** regular. I’ll assume the language is:

  
$$


L \;=\;\bigl\{\, w \in \{a,b\}^* \;\bigm|\; \#a(w) = 2\,\#b(w)\bigr\}.


$$
  

(That is, the number of s in any word is exactly twice the number of s.)

  

**1. Pumping Lemma (brief recap)**

  

If were regular, then there exists a “pumping length” (sometimes denoted ) such that **any** string with \(\lvert s\rvert \ge n\) can be decomposed into satisfying:

1. \(\lvert xy\rvert \le n\),

2. \(\lvert y\rvert > 0\), and

3. For **all** , the string .

  

To prove is **not** regular, you assume **is** regular and derive a contradiction by showing there’s at least one string in for which pumping (increasing or decreasing the number of copies of ) **cannot** remain in .

  

**2. Choosing a String** **in**

  

Given the pumping length , pick a specific string in that is **long enough**—usually something that clearly exhibits the “twice as many s as s” structure. A common choice is:

  

• Number of s: .

• Number of s: .

• Clearly, \(\lvert w\rvert = 3n \ge n\), so is a valid candidate for the lemma.

• Also, because and , so indeed .

  

**3. Decomposing**

  

By the Pumping Lemma, if is regular, then **any** decomposition with \(\lvert xy\rvert \le n\) and \(\lvert y\rvert > 0\) must allow pumping . But notice:

1. \(\lvert xy\rvert \le n\).

Since starts with copies of b, that means and lie entirely in the **first** b**s**.

• In other words, is some (nonempty) prefix of .

• So consists **only** of bs. Suppose \(\lvert y\rvert = k \ge 1\). Then .

2. \(\lvert y\rvert > 0\).

That ensures (the number of bs in ) is at least 1.

  

Hence, we can write:

where .

  

**4. Pumping**

  

The lemma says that for **all** integers , should remain in . Let’s check (pumping “up” once). Then the new string is:

  

\[

x\,y^2\,z \;=\; b^{m} \; \underbrace{b^k\,b^k}_{b^{2k}}\; b^{n - (m + k)}\,a^{2n}

\;=\; b^{m + 2k + (n - (m + k))}\, a^{2n}

\;=\; b^{\,n + k}\, a^{2n}.

\]

• Now the number of bs is .

• The number of as remains .

  

**5. Checking Membership in**

  

For to be in , we would need:

  

  

But (since ), so . Thus:

  

\[

\#a\bigl(x\,y^2\,z\bigr) \;=\; 2n,

\quad

\#b\bigl(x\,y^2\,z\bigr) \;=\; n + k,

\quad

\text{so}

\quad

2n \;\neq\; 2\,(n + k).

\]

  

Hence . This contradicts the requirement that **all** pumped strings remain in .

  

**6. Conclusion**

  

Because we found a string of length (the pumping length) for which the pumping property fails, our **initial assumption**—that is regular—must be false. Therefore, is **not** regular.

  

**Why the Red Part?**

  

In your notes, the “red part” likely refers to the step of **pumping** (i.e., replacing with ) and showing that the resulting string fails the condition \(\lvert w\rvert_a = 2\,\lvert w\rvert_b\). That’s the crux of the contradiction:

1. You’ve identified that is some nonempty substring of the bs.

2. By doubling , you **increase the count of** b**s** but **not** the count of as.

3. The ratio #a : #b is no longer 2:1, so it’s no longer in .

  

That breaks the pumping lemma condition, proving non-regularity.

  

**Summary**

• We use the pumping lemma to assume the language is regular.

• We pick a carefully chosen string .

• We show that any valid pumping decomposition would force us to break the ratio of as to bs.

• Hence, the language cannot be regular.

  

In simpler terms: **once you fix the ratio #a = 2 * #b, “pumping” extra** b**s (or removing some) will ruin that ratio.**
