2 Types of methods : supervised methods vs non supervised methods 
Problems that require data : supervised problems 


Regression example : 
predict reasonable price for a used car 
predict price for real estate in the city 


meaning what we want to predict is continous 


Classification : 
discreet, only so many values we could choose 
- news paper article :  predict what topic it is, news, sports, 
- determine disease : either a patient has covid, or they dont 

it is possible to *cast* regression problems to classification problems
either a used is interested in a movie, or they are not 
At the End, either yes or no, or : politics, sports, etc.
	methods under the hood predict probability values 


Clustering : 
Given Data, group them, make sense of them, 
Data points in a cluster have a high coherence, DP in different clusters are not coherent

After Clustering : goal is to have a typical Classification of the data points 
Grouping based on contents of the data 


Neural Networks : 

back to 1940s, originally inspired by human brain of mammals works 
People didnt understand how to train neural networks 

~2010 Neural Networks got a revival 
training on GPUs is much better than on CPUs 
LLMs are based on a special form of neural networks : transformers 


we can learn from Models : a car that has been driven a million miles has a worse condition than cars with fewer miles 

In the last 20 years machine learning has become common, before companies didnt record data, nowadays there is much more data to be used 

Recommend Systems, search, etc. are being driven by machine learning 

there is structured data, and semi-structured data
we will focus on structured data 

rows : datapoints 
columns : features 

there are also un-strucuted and semi-structured data 

un-structured : sequence of characters, example : E-Mail 
semi-structured : content doesnt have a fixed structure

many methods rely on structured data

we are not interested in data types, but types of features 
german : " skalen niveau "
Essentially : what operations can we apply to them 

### 1 Nominal Features  ( =, != )
we can compare two values -> is it the same value ? 
> e.g gender of person, color of car 

what is the most frequent value ? 
` We can not compute anything with it ` `

does it make sense to compute a mean ? 

### 2 Ordinal Features ( < , > )
We can do everything we can do with nominal features and more 

There is a *natural order* in features : 
> e.g customer satisfaction level, energy class of car 

A - customer is really satisfied 
B - customer is okay with it
C...


### 3 Numerical Features ( +, -, * , / )
anything we can do with nominal and ordinal feaetures 
Numerical Features allow arithmetic operations : 

> e.g income of household, number of emissions,

 We can : compute difference, mean, variance, 


EstateType : Nominal Feature 
EnergyClass : Ordinal Features 
MonthlyRent, Area, DistanceToCenter : Numerical Features 


## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning 
Supervised methods assume that training data is available -> target feature 
Unsuoervised Learning : task is not to structure data, but find out what DP do not look like other data points 
	which temperature points do not make sense -> temp sensor recording 2000ยบ


## Regression 
One ore more features, 
we want to predict another feature, they are numerical
we need to make a model assumption 

x-axis feature is given 
y-axis feature we want to predict 

for hte training data, we know the correct value for y 

we identify a plane, find a plane that best approximates data points 
how can we fit more complex data points ? 


## Classification 
Decision Trees being used to determine e.g a Topic of an article 
We can see why a document was classified as a sports, politics document 


## Neural Networks 
backbone of artifical intelligence 
we learn to approximate arbitrary functions 
	any function that evaluates to true / false 


# Remember : 
Types of Features : Nominal, Ordinal, Numerical Features
